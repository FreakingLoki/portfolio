            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I'm an aspiring full stack web developer from central Maine. 
                I spent some time enrolled at Norwich University studying the wrong topic. 
                When I left college I got a job at Performance Food Group as a night shift order selector. 
                From there I worked my way up to the role of Driver Check-In Coordinator. 
                This is an inventory control and quality control focued position which ensures fair reimbursment 
                to customers and protects the company from unnecessary losses while keeping accurate inventory counts.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was inspired to give programming and coding a try begining in 2022 when my wife decided to go 
                back to school. I've always had interest in computer hardware and software. I've 
                built and rebuilt PCs and laptops. When I was in middle school I tried learning Visual Basic, but 
                I could not wrap my head around it back then. It didn't help that every time I sat down with the 
                intent to learn I would get distracted by video games on my old PC.
