                        This is the website you are currently visiting. Built with HTML, 
                        CSS, and JS, I took my time with the design of this website and 
                        I think it came out beautifully. I worked pretty hard getting the 
                        color scheme to be beautiful and high contrast enough so that anyone 
                        can read it.

                        A turn based text game built with HTML, CSS, and JS. This project 
                        was a challenging exercise in DOM manipulation and Promises and is 
                        by far the largest project I have built so far. It is several 
                        thousand lines of code. It took me about two months to build. I 
                        had to take it slow (only a few hours a week) because I was still 
                        very new to JavaScript when I started this project. This one project 
                        taught me a lot though, so I'm very glad that I went beyond the 
                        scope of the project that I was assigned. I also learned a thing 
                        or two about scope creep!

                        designed webpage I created. It was built with HTML, and CSS with 
                        and emphasis on CSS Flexbox. This was the "capstone" project for 
                        my early CSS courses.
