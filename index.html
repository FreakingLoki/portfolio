            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p id="part-one">
                I'm an aspiring full stack web developer from central Maine. 
                I spent some time enrolled at Norwich University studying Civil Engineering 
                which turned out to be the wrong major for me. I left Norwich in 2014. When 
                I left college I got a job at Performance Food Group as a night shift order 
                selector. From there I worked my way up to the role of Driver Check-In 
                Coordinator. This is an inventory control and quality control focued 
                position which ensures fair reimbursment to customers and protects the 
                company from unnecessary losses while keeping accurate inventory counts.
                I was inspired to give programming and coding a try begining in 2022 when 
                my wife decided to go back to school. I've always had interest in computer 
                hardware and software. I've built and rebuilt PCs and laptops. When I was 
                in middle school I tried learning Visual Basic, but I could not wrap my 
                head around it back then. It didn't help that every time I sat down with 
                the intent to learn I would get distracted by video games on my old PC.

            </p>

            <p id="part-two">
                I have several hobbies, but I have trouble finding time to dedicate to 
                them. Being a parent, homeowner, full time employee, and a student take 
                up most of my free time. I still manage to find time to dedicate to playing 
                video games, woodworking, and spending time outdoors with my family. I 
                attempted to learn how to play guitar several years ago, and I learned 
                some chords before deciding to stick to the drums. I've been playing 
                the drums (only as a hobbiest, never in a group) for several years. 
                I've been playing video games for my entire life, starting on the PC 
                of course with games like Wolfenstein, Unreal Tournament, and Command 
                and Conquer. As a new homeowner I decided to take up woodworking, 
                hoping to learn some DIY skills and save some money on any repairs 
                we may need. My first big woodworking project was a firewood storage 
                structure. I think my next will be something smaller, maybe a piece of 
                furniture.
