            <h4>Details</h4>
            <p>
                I began my professional career here after leaving college in 2014. I 
                started on the night shift as an Order Selector. Accuracy was the most 
                important aspect of this work, but other challenges included working 
                extremely long hours and working at a very fast pace for the entirety of 
                those long shifts. Luckily my background in long distance running taught 
                me a lot about setting a fast pace.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                In the fall of 2016 I interveiwed for a new position within the company 
                where I would be able to get away from being a nocturnal being. I took a pay 
                cut, but I was willing to make that trade. The job title I was offered (and 
                still have) was Driver Check-In Coordinator. This job has changed a lot since 
                I took it over. In the begining I was only responsible for checking returned 
                product for quality and ensuring the item we were restocking in our inventory 
                database matched the actual item being returned. However in 2019 there were 
                many changes made for the sake of Covid-19 safety. One of those meant I had 
                to limit contact with truck drivers. I'm now responsible for offloading the 
                products and empty pallets from the drivers' trailers when they return to the 
                warehosue at the end of their run each day. I'm back to working at a very fast pace 
                while ensuring I stay accurate with my quality and product checks. I have training 
                in HAACP procedures as well as some familiarity with DOT regulations and more 
                knowledge about food safety than my wife cares to hear about.

                            <p>
                                I have been working with HTML5 since 2022, but I've 
                                had exposure to it since the late 2000s. I tried my 
                                hand at learning some code when I was in high school, 
                                but I had a lot on my mind and a lot on my plate and 
                                not much focus back then. Since I "reset" and drilled 
                                down into what I want to do I've built several webpages.
                                My GitHub account (as of April 2023) has six 
                                repositories on it, but not all of them are well 
                                built enough to be public. I would prefer to only 
                                present my best work. I have taken and passed the 
                                Codecademy HTML assessment exam
                            </p>

                                I have been working with CSS3 for as long as I have 
                                been working with HTML5 of course. The two are 
                                inexorably linked. Every page I build gets better 
                                and better. I like to use CSS Flexbox, but I want 
                                to build with CSS Grid more in my next project. 
                                I think I lean on Flexbox more out of habit because 
                                I am more familiar with it.

                                JavaScript was a new challenge for me when I first 
                                started working with in in late 2022. The only 
                                experience I had with anything similar before 
                                then was I had tried to learn Visual Basic in 
                                the 2000s. I gave that up because I had no idea 
                                what I would want to use it for. After starting 
                                JavaScript through Codecademy however, I quickly 
                                knew what my first project with it would be; a 
                                simple game. Playing games is one of my 
                                favorite hobbies, so naturally Math.random() was 
                                an inspiration for my largest project, the text 
                                based simple role playing game I built in early 2023.

                                developers for a local Maine company. I've been tinkering 
                                and playing games on Windows for my entire life. I've built 
                                gaming PCs and I've spent my fair share of frustrated afternoons 
                                troubleshooting BSODs and corrupt installations. I've even 
                                spent some time fighting off malware, but luckily that has 
                                not been an issue for me or my family for some time.

                                Microsoft Office tools have been a part of my life for 
                                as long as I've been working on PCs. Since elementary school
                                computer class I've been typing away in Word. Excel is an 
                                application I use daily at work now alongside Outlook. I 
                                know my way around PowerPoint of course, but some of the other 
                                tools I'm less familiar with.

                                paste commands while troubleshooting something. Now I can 
                                comfortably navigate my entire PC with the CLI and it feels more 
                                natural in some aspects than using the GUI.

                                Man Git is cool. I always wondered how larger companies had 
                                their big developer teams working on the same thing at the same time 
                                and after learning Git and all makes so much more sense. Using 
                                Git for version control or to branch out to work on a new feature without 
                                breaking everything in the main branch just makes so much sense that I 
                                felt a little dimwitted that I hadn't puzzled it out myself before 
                                Codecademy taught it to me. I have used Git in combination with 
                                GitHub since I learned how to use both tools and sometimes I wish 
                                I could use them for my current job to make changes to an excel file... 
                                Maybe once I have more experiance I could puzzle out something like that.

                                GitHub is just as awesome as Git. I had heard of it and even visited 
                                and read some READMEs and used some tools from GitHub before I 
                                learned how to make my own repositories and host my own projects there. 
                                It is a fun thing to just browse (and usually more productive than reddit)
                                and see the sort of things other people are working on.

                                Responsive design is so important these days. I don't have the 
                                numbers in front of me, but I'm willing to bet the vast majority of 
                                people that visit any website or web application are going to do so 
                                from a mobile device or tablet. Mobile devices are so much easier to 
                                access that if you're deigning your website or application without 
                                accounting for smaller screens you are going to miss out on almost the 
                                entire market. I have a home PC that I built myself for gaming and for 
                                working on learning to be a full stack developer, but I know I am in the 
                                minority. Almost everyone that accesses the internet will do so way more from 
                                the device in their pocket than from a home office or even a laptop.

                                This is very important too if you hope to be able to market your 
                                product to the entire population. I've been following the really cool 
                                stuff that Xbox has been working on with their Xbox Adaptive Controller 
                                to make gaming accessible to as many people as possible, and if I want 
                                to build a quality, respectable product I need to do the same thing. I'm 
                                still learning how to do this well, but it is something that I think is 
                                highly important and I will be striving to make every project I work on 
                                accessible to as many people as possible.

                            My current job requires me to be able to distinguish between 
                            thousands of products using mostly a six-digit product number 
                            system and a short, abbreviated description. I also need to 
                            accurately identify expiration dates and signs of spoilage or 
                            temperature abuse. Programming has a lot of similar problems. 
                            One typo can break an entire application.

                            Small design choices can mean the difference between a website 
                            that looks like it was built in the early myspace era or something 
                            as modern as Google's Material Design. I'm no art student, but I 
                            do try my best to look for inspiration before I start designing the 
                            look of something. I spent a solid hour trying to pick between fonts 
                            for this website.

                            I spent my high school and junior high years running long distance in 
                            track and cross country. Set your pace and stick to it. I have set times 
                            of day that I work on certain things. I get up and make the coffee every 
                            morning for my wife and I, then I sit down for three hours to practice. I 
                            stay focused by putting on quiet, familiar music (so that I'm not distracted 
                            by deep diving into a new artist) and just plug away at whatever I need to work 
                            on until it is time for breakfast. If I didn't have to work for a living I would 
                            be in front of this screen all day and I would still enjoy every minute of it.

                            I wouldn't want to use a mediocre product, so why would I want to put one 
                            out there for someone else to use? I do a lot of research before buying 
                            a new tool or product for myself and my family. I work hard for my money 
                            so I expect the person accepting my money for their product would work 
                            just as hard to ensure a good experience. I do the same every day at work. 
                            I wouldn't want to slack off and let someone buy a case of spoiled produce. 
                            High quality work begets high quality relationships with your customers and 
                            your co-workers.

                            I show up every day. I do my work in the same way every day. I practice 
                            coding every week on the same days for the same amount of time. I get 
                            my household chores done in the same manner every day. I like to be 
                            consistent because I like people that I know to know that they can rely on me.

                            I hate being the last one to show up to something. I went to a concert in 
                            Boston several years ago and my friend and I got there very very early to 
                            ensure that we would get in quickly even though the show had assigned seating. 
                            I make sure I get to family functions, work, and any other appointments I may 
                            have 10-15 minutes early. Google Maps is good, but traffic can change in a matter of 
                            minutes. I don't mind waiting for someone else, because I understand that life happens. 
                            I have a wife and a daughter, I know that not everything can be done on time, and 
                            sometimes all of us forget things. I like to use alarms on my mobile phone and I 
                            use my calender for a lot of things that someone else might not.

                        <p>
                            As part of my professinal development I took a workplace personality test. That 
                            test said my personality type was that of a craftsman. I prefer to keep my head 
                            down and work at a task, one task at a time, until the task is complete. I have great 
                            attention to detail and workmanship as well as a deep respect for any rules I may 
                            need to enforce or follow. I don't like "gray areas" where there is not a clear 
                            right or wrong way to get something done. I think this is why I developed an interest 
                            in both woodworking (as a hobby) and programming. I take great pride in a job well done.
