            <h4>Details</h4>
            <p>
                I began my professional career here after leaving college in 2014. I 
                started on the night shift as an Order Selector. Accuracy was the most 
                important aspect of this work, but other challenges included working 
                extremely long hours and working at a very fast pace for the entirety of 
                those long shifts. Luckily my background in long distance running taught 
                me a lot about setting a fast pace.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                In the fall of 2016 I interveiwed for a new position within the company 
                where I would be able to get away from being a nocturnal being. I took a pay 
                cut, but I was willing to make that trade. The job title I was offered (and 
                still have) was Driver Check-In Coordinator. This job has changed a lot since 
                I took it over. In the begining I was only responsible for checking returned 
                product for quality and ensuring the item we were restocking in our inventory 
                database matched the actual item being returned. However in 2019 there were 
                many changes made for the sake of Covid-19 safety. One of those meant I had 
                to limit contact with truck drivers. I'm now responsible for offloading the 
                products and empty pallets from the drivers' trailers when they return to the 
                warehosue at the end of their run each day. I'm back to working at a very fast pace 
                while ensuring I stay accurate with my quality and product checks. I have training 
                in HAACP procedures as well as some familiarity with DOT regulations and more 
                knowledge about food safety than my wife cares to hear about.
