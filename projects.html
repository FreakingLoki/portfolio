                This was a great learning experience for me about project scope. This 
                project began as a part of my coding lessons. It was supposed to be 
                a small mad lib like JavaScript program that took in a few inputs 
                from the user and output a randomized message. It turned into a two 
                month long project where I became quite comfortable working with JavaScript 
                and manipulating the DOM. I even learned a little bit about Promises while 
                building this. It is a small, endless, turn based, text game with character classes 
                and stats based on the core of many video and board games; a random number 
                generator. It is not yet complete to my satisfaction, but I do consider it 
                complete enough to display here.

                This project was another of the projects I worked on as part of my coding lessons. 
                It was meant to be an exercise in CSS Flexbox. I'm quite proud of how it turned out. 
                The page was built using many web resources. The theme o fthe page was inspired by 
                one of my favorite podcasts, My Brother, My Brother and Me.
