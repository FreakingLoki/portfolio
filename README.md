# Jesse's Portfolio Website
*project work started April 10 2023*
---
This project was one of the "capstone" projects from my courses on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). It combines my knowledge of
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript along with responsive design and accessibility features to make one of my best designed projects to date. It is not 
100% complete yet, but it is close. See below for a list of work I still need to finish.

## To Do

- [ ] Add media queries for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add any missing accessibility features
- [ ] Increase comments for better code readability
- [ ] Adjust styling of links on index.html to be more obviously clickable
- [ ] Add details to the dropdown cards in the skills section on resume.html
- [ ] Add details to the slideshow cards on index.html

## Possible Bonus Improvements

- [ ] use JavaScript to add animation to slideshow cards on index.html when the next/prev buttons are clicked
- [ ] use JavaScript to add animation to the dropdown cards when they are expanded on resume.html
- [ ] maybe add some small animation the the main h1 header on index.html on hover
- [ ] make the JH logo interactive and when clicked open a navigation menu to all of my projects
