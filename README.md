# Jesse's Portfolio Website
*project work started April 10 2023*
This project is one of the "capstone" projects from my courses on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). It combines my knowledge of
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript along with responsive design and accessibility features to make one of my best designed projects to date. It is not 
100% complete yet, but it is close. See below for a list of work I still need to finish.

## To Do
#### Readability
- [x] Added an icon to the website to increase the attractiveness
- [x] Increased comments for better code readability
- [x] Adjust styling of links on index.html to be more obviously clickable
- [x] Added adaptive height to the Skills and Attributes section of resume.html so that when dropdown cards are open they don't overflow the section
- [x] Added rules to stylesheets and refactored code to match new rules

#### Responsiveness and Accessibility
- [x] Added media queries for responsiveness to different screen sizes
- [x] Adjusted font size and colors for better contrast
- [x] Added missing accessibility labels
- [ ] Add keyboard controls to all major interactive elements

#### Site Content
- [x] Added details to the dropdown cards in the skills section on resume.html
- [x] Added details to the slideshow cards on index.html

## Possible Bonus Improvements

- [x] modified JavaScript and CSS to add a slide in/out effect to the slide transitions
- [x] added animation effects to the dropdown cards on resume.html by modifying their max-height property with JavaScript
- [ ] maybe add some small animation the the main h1 header on index.html on hover
- [ ] make the JH logo interactive and when clicked open a navigation menu to all of my projects
- [ ] add a downloadable PDF version of my resume? not sure if this is possible with GitHub Pages, further research is required first
